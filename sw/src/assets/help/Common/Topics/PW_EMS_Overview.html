    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Parallel Wireles Element Management System (PW EMS) is a suite of Web-based
        applications used for management and monitoring of all Parallel Wireless network elements
        that can be deployed in a virtualized or cloud-native environment.</p>
        <p class="p"></p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS provides the following functionality:</p>
        <ul class="ul" id="Overview__ul_pgj_sq2_x4b">
            <li class="li">Devices can be configured and managed, which includes the logical grouping of
                multiple cells and optionally applying a defined configuration to multiple cells.
                Also, changes to multiple cells can be triggered, based on configuration
                updates.</li>
            <li class="li">Full support for fault management, configuration management, accounting,
                performance, and security (FCAPS).</li>
            <li class="li">Enables configuration of the Virtual Baseband Unit (vBBU) and provides network
                monitoring and fault management for both the vBBU and HetNet Gateway (HNG).</li>
            <li class="li">Integrated support for existing Northbound Operations Support Systems (OSS)
                functions for alarms (through SNMP), statistics (REST API), inventory information,
                device health status, and counter management for all managed devices.</li>
            <li class="li">Supports Self-Organizing Network (SON) system functions for Automatic Neighbor
                Relation (ANR) management of cells based on the X2 gateway service (HNG) and user
                equipment (UE) measurement reports.</li>
            <li class="li">Access control is provided to support the following administrative abilities:<ul class="ul" id="Overview__ul_a3d_cnr_lpb">
                    <li class="li">Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to create multiple groups of users and
                        organizations with designated security permissions to allow granular access
                        control for each role or user group.</li>
                    <li class="li">LDAP integration for centralizing user authentication and
                        authorization.</li>
                    <li class="li">Audit logging to track each RBAC operation that is performed on the
                        system.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li class="li">Operators can do performance management through PW EMS Network Monitoring. Flexible
                dashboards can be configured, customized and used to monitor Key Performance
                Indicators (KPIs) that provide an in-depth analysis of the network. Configured
                thresholds in this application can be used to alert operators to performance changes
                on their network.</li>
            <li class="li">Upgrade devices and track the status of these upgrades in real time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p page-break-before">The service provider network elements shown below are managed
            and controlled by the PW EMS. Some of the elements shown below are described in greater
            detail in the following sections:</p>
