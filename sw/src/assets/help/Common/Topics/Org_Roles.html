                    <li class="li">Can add, edit, and delete data sources.</li>

            <div class="p">This user role has the following abilities and limitations:<ul class="ul" id="Organization_Roles__ul_tgn_qws_hpb">
                    <li class="li">Can view, add, and edit dashboards, panels, and alert rules in dashboards to
                        which they have access. This can be disabled on specific folders and
                        dashboards.</li>
                    <li class="li">Can create, update, or delete play lists.</li>

                </ul></div>
            <p class="p">This user role can be edited by way of the Grafana server setting
                    <code class="ph codeph">editors_can_admin</code>. If this parameter is set to true, then users
                with this role can also administrate dashboards, folders and teams they create. This
                is especially useful for enabling self-organizing teams to administer their own
                dashboards.</p>

        <section class="section" id="Organization_Roles__section_xsf_4ws_hpb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Viewer Role</h2>
            
            <ul class="ul" id="Organization_Roles__ul_ld3_kys_hpb">
                <li class="li">Can view any dashboard they have access to. This can be disabled on specific
                    folders and dashboards.</li>
                <li class="li">Cannot add, edit, or delete data sources.</li>

            <p class="p">The viewer role can be modified through the Grafana server parameter setting
                    <code class="ph codeph">viewers_can_edit</code>. If the value of this parameter set this to
                true, then users with the Viewer role can also make transient dashboard edits, which
                allows the modification of panels and queries, but not the ability to change, create
                or save new dashboards. This change is used often for public Grafana installations
                where anonymous users are allowed to edit panels and do queries, but are not allowed
                to save or create new dashboards.</p>
