    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The Self-Organizing Network (SON) is a service of the PW EMS that serves as an umbrella
            of diverse system functions that automate and provide intelligent operations for
            managing the setup, optimization, performance, and availability of a wireless network.
            This includes the configuration operations required to make access devices operational
            and available to service User Equipment (UE) devices. The PW EMS SON uses its static
            configuration and intelligent operations to manage and orchestrate the wireless Radio
            Access Network (RAN) across 2G and 4G technologies. This makes the RAN more functional,
            useful, and efficient with minimal human intervention to reduce complexity and human
            error and maximize functionality and performance.</p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS SON is responsible for the configuration and management of the access nodes
            aggregated by the HetNet Gateway (HNG) and is built and designed around a micro-services
            architecture where different micro-services handle different interfaces and functions.
            All the micro-services are deployed as containers and managed, orchestrated through
            Kubernetes. PW EMS SON also manages the virtual radio node (vNode) specific features
            like alarms, bulk statistics, and software upgrade. A vNode is an access node on a
            virtual baseband unit (vBBU) that can contain multiple 2G and 4G cells.</p>
        <p class="p">The following diagram depicts the network architecture of the overall Parallel Wireless
            solution depicting vNode (vBBU), HNG, and PW EMS SON as separate entities with the
            interfaces among them deployed in a 4G environment. The interface between the HNG and
            SON for the radio access services is a REST-based interface.</p>
        <p class="p">

        </p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS SON uses the Physical Cell ID (PCI) neighbor identifier for Automatic Neighbor
            Relations (ANR) to reduce the frequency of neighbor information updates among virtual
            nodes. The PW EMS SON instances manage the non-overlapping sets of access nodes.</p>
        <p class="p">The security gateway ensures a secure IPsec-based communication between the HNG and vBBU.
            The IPsec tunnel secures all of the TR-069 data as well as the back-channel
            activities.</p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS SON accomplishes the following list of tasks with TR-069:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Bringing up a Cell</li>
            <li class="li">Disabling Admin State</li>
            <li class="li">Adding Neighbor Cells to the PW EMS through ANR</li>
            <li class="li"> Indicating Cell Status from vNodes</li>
            <li class="li"> Uploading vBBU Inventory in SON Database</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS SON handles a diverse set of automated and intelligent system operations for
            managing wireless network device setup, optimization, performance, and availability.
            Additionally, within the PW solution, the PW EMS SON provides the full set of
            configuration operations required to deploy access devices such as the vBBU, vNodes, and
            access nodes having 2G and 4G cells (CWS or RRH) to provide services to UEs. The PW EMS
            SON is a combination of static configuration and automated and algorithmic operations
            interacting to make the wireless access network functional, useful, and efficient with
            minimal human intervention.</p>
