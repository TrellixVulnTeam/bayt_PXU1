    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use this chapter to create profiles for 2G and 4G devices.</p>
        <p class="p">Profiles can be used to manage configurations. The PW EMS provides several preexisting
            profiles that can be used for service provider 2G and 4G devices. These profiles contain
            default parameters that can be modified directly through the PW EMS, or downloaded from
            the PW EMS as a json file, which can then be modified and uploaded to the PW EMS. A
            default profile can be saved as a new profile and uploaded. This new profile can have
            different parameters based on the service provider network to which it is applied and be
            provided with a new name for its purpose or for what it is about. There is no limit to
            the number of profiles that can be created. When a profile is changed, it is propagated
            to all associated cells. Any changes to a profile that are made can be applied to a vBBU
            or cells immediately or scheduled to be applied to them at a later time to avoid
            disrupting service.</p>
