    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">High Availability (HA) redundancy is provided for the PW EMS through the Kubernetes
        virtual platform on which it runs.</p>
        <p class="p">The Kubernetes virtual environment can be installed on a single server or multiple
            servers. HA synchronizes information, device configuration, system security, alarm and
            event notification settings, and system backup and upgrade settings in case of a
            failover scenario.</p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS application is installed in a virtual environment that consists of one or more
            Kubernetes master nodes and one or more worker nodes, which contain pods.</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">A master is a collection of three server processes: apiserver, control manager and kube scheduler that run on a single node in a cluster which is designated as the master. The master controls each worker node.</li>
            <li class="li">A worker node is a worker system in Kubernetes. This node type has the container runtime services, kubelet and kube- proxy services, which are necessary to run one or more pods and is managed by master components.</li>
            <li class="li"> A pod runs as a process on a node that can be part of a cluster that can be scaled
                up or down. A pod is the smallest deployable object in Kubernetes that can have one
                or more containers. The PW EMS instance runs in a pod container.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">A user can be logged into a "replica" pod that contains an instance of the PW EMS UI. If
            this pod crashes for some reason, the PW EMS UI users are automatically logged out of
            this pod and need to log in again. Users that are logged into other replica pods that
            each have a PW EMS instance are unaffected. Multiple replica pods can exist on the same
            node or multiple nodes can contain an PW EMS instance that can be used in the customer
            deployment of the PW EMS application. These different deployments can help distribute
            HTTP requests across the different pods. There are multiple ways in which the Kubernetes
            virtual environment can be deployed for HA. </p>

            about how the PW EMS can be deployed for HA.</p>
