    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Parallel Wireless Element Management System (PW EMS) Monitoring and Reporting
        application is provided through a Web User Interface (UI). This application collects device
        data from the system and presents it in interactive charts, graphs, Key Performance
        Indicators (KPIs), and alerts so operators can respond to the way devices are performing on
        the network.</p>
        <p class="p">PW EMS Monitoring and Reporting uses the open-source software application Grafana as a
            platform to obtain data, which analyzes, measures, and reports network performance using
            data collected periodically from network components managed by the PW EMS. Different use
            cases collect and process all wireless network element configuration, fault, alarm,
            event, performance, and security management functions.</p>
        <p class="p">The PW EMS uses its SON functionality to monitor, measure, and optimize operations of the
            radio access network (RAN) and core mobile network, which includes the network
            configuration, events, logs, alarms, counters, KPIs and so on. This data is collected
            from devices such as the HetNet Gateway (HNG) device and access network devices such as
            Virtual Baseband Unit (vBBU), Remote Radio Head (RRH), and Converged Wireless System
            (CWS) devices.</p>
