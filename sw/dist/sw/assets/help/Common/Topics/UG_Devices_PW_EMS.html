        provided by your Parallel Wireless representative.</p>
        <p class="p"> The upgrade software image file must be loaded on the local system (on which the web
            browser runs the PW EMS session) before starting the upgrade process. Software from the
            following device types can be downloaded from a local system and later activated
            (rebooted so they activate the new software). The following software image file prefixes
            help indicate the type of devices that are associated with them:</p>
