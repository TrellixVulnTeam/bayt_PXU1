    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The HetNet Gateway (HNG) is used to virtualize and aggregate multiple technology
        Radio Access Network (RAN) interfaces to manage GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), and LTE (4G)
        cells.</p>
        <p class="p"> </p>
        <p class="p">The HNG is situated between Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network and uses standard
            backhaul capabilities. It  reduces network complexity by abstracting different RANs, and
            by abstracting changes from the Core network to the RAN and from the the RAN to the core
            network. For example, the HNG can virtualize thousands of base stations to look like a
            few virtualized super cells (boomer cell) to the core service provider network.</p>
        <p class="p">The HNG has the following capabilities that are supported across the network: </p>
        <ul class="ul" id="Near_Real_Time_Radio_Access_Network__RAN__Intelligent_Controller__ul_rtq_xtj_lpb">
            <li class="li">Acts as a RAN controller that can aggregate all RAN interfaces.</li>
            <li class="li">Provides X2 gateway functionality for interference mitigation and inter-RAN
                mobility.</li>
            <li class="li">Supports an LTE small cell gateway (base station), which is comprised of the Home
                eNodeB (HeNBGW), Home Node B Gateway (HNB GW), and virtual Radio Network Controller
                (RNC), and the LTE security gateway that is to set up an IPsec tunnel with the
                eNodeB to encrypt all traffic between the eNodeBs.</li>
            <li class="li">Supports Multiple Operator Core Network (MOCN) for sharing the access network
                (NodeB, eNodeB) between two or more network operators.</li>
            <li class="li">Complies with ETSI network functions virtualization (NFV) for Virtual Network
                Funtions (NFV).</li>
            <li class="li">Allows multiple vendors on the RAN and multi-technologies to be used.</li>
            <li class="li">Reduces overall network signaling towards the Core network.</li>
            <li class="li">Aggregates interfaces towards core network.</li>
