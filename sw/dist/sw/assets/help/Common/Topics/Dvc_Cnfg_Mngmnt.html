    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Once the appropriate system profiles are configured, and if any 2G or 4G profles are
        configured or modified on the PW EMS, you can power on all vBBUs. Before doing so, ensure
        that they are pre-provisioned for the PW EMS system by using the vBBU Web Commisioning Tool
        (WCT). Refer to the <span class="ph"><em class="ph i">Virtual Baseband Unit Server Commissioning Guide</em></span> for more information about setting up a vBBU server and pre-provisioning a vBBU, its
        vNodes, and cells.</p>
        <p class="p">Use the tasks in this chapter to configure a vBBU and its associated vNodes, which
            includes metadata such as naming and location information. The PW EMS allows the
            configuration of user-specified vBBU names, vNode names, and cell names that help
            identify them when they are viewed in counters and statistics and various areas of the
            PW EMS GUI, such as the <strong class="ph b">Device Summary</strong> window, and PW EMS Monitoring
            dashboards.</p>
        <p class="p">Default or available profiles can be applied to a vBBU and its vNodes, and service can be
            created for individual vNodes that can contain both 2G and 4G cells. </p>
        <p class="p">Multiple vBBUs and vNodes can be rebooted, their configurations changed or uploaded in a
            bulk process by using the tasks described in this chapter. Also, LTE and GSM service
            parameters can be viewed for a connected HetNet Gateway (HNG) and the status of all
            devices can be changed, monitored or modified.</p>
